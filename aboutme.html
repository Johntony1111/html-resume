    At SPIN VFX, my expertise in 3D lighting and visual effects breathes life into feature films, shaping narratives through the interplay of light and shadow. The competencies honed at Moving Picture Company and SPIN VFX, such as lighting optimization and rendering with Renderman, enable seamless integration across departments for layout and lookdev precision.

    Collaborating with supervisors and leads, we've navigated tight deadlines and delivered visually compelling shots that enhance storytelling. My commitment to teamwork, continuous learning, and clear communication underpins my passion for animation and VFX, empowering our team to push the boundaries of digital artistry.
